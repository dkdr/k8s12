# Helm

## Install helm

It would be nice to install helm before we begin, and to do so, you'll need to run below commands
```shell
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
```

Let's see if it really works
```shell
λ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.11.0", GitCommit:"472c5736ab01133de504a826bd9ee12cbe4e7904", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.18.10"}
```
